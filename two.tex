2. Say whether the following is true or false and support your answer by a proof: 
The sum of any five consecutive integers is divisible by 5 (without remainder).

\begin{proof}

  By mathematical induction.

  For any integer $x$ the sum of the first 5 consecutive integers is given by:

  $$x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) = 5n $$

  For $x = 1$, we have:
\begin{align*} 
  1 + (1 + 1) + (1 + 2) + (1 + 3) + (1 + 4) &= 5n \\
  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 &= 5n \\
  15 &= 5n \\
  3 &= n
\end{align*}

Subsituting $x + 1$ for $x$ we have:

\begin{align*} 
&= (x + 1) + ((x + 1) + 1) + ((x + 1) + 2) + ((x + 1) + 3) + ((x + 1) + 4) 
  \tag{subsitute x+1} \\
&= 5 + (x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4)) 
  \tag{bring plus ones out the front} \\
&= 5 + 5n \\ \tag{from the inductive statement} \\
&= 5(1 + n)
\end{align*}

This proves that the inductive statement is true for $x + 1$, therefore proving
by the principle of mathematical induction that the theorem is true.
  
\end{proof}

1. Say whether the following is true or false and support your answer by a proof. 

$$(\exists m,n \in \mathbb{N}) (3m + 5n = 12)$$

This statement is false.

\begin{proof}
Let $n = 1$. Solve the equation for incremental values of $m$ starting with the smallest natural number until the solution is greater than 12

\begin{align*} 
  3m + 5n &= x \\ 
  (3 \times 1) + 5 &= 8 \\
  (3 \times 2) + 5 &= 11 \\
  (3 \times 3) + 5 &= 14
\end{align*}

And similarly for $m = 1$, solve the equation for incremental values of $n$

\begin{align*} 
  3m + 5n &= x \\ 
  3 + (5 \times 1) &= 8 \\
  3 + (5 \times 2) &= 13
\end{align*}

Clearly any further increment of either $m$ or $n$ results in a solution that is
greater than 12. The theorem is therefore false.
\end{proof}

6. A classic unsolved problem in number theory asks if there are infinitely many pairs of "twin primes", pairs of primes separated by 2, such as 3 and 5, 11 and 13, or 71 and 73. Prove that the only prime triple (i.e. three primes, each 2 from the next) is 3, 5, 7.

\begin{proof}

  Proof by contradiction.

  Assume: ($n \in \mathbb{N})(n > 3 $) and $n$, $n + 1$, $n + 4$ is a prime triple.

  By the proof in question 5 one of the prime numbers in the triple is divisible
  by 3 (since n is not 3). It is therefore, by definition, not a prime number - this is a contradiction.

\end{proof}

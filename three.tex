3. Say whether the following is true or false and support your answer by a
proof: For any integer $n$, the number $n^2 + n + 1$ is odd.

\begin{proof}

  Proof by contradiction.

  Assume: $\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n$ is even.

  Since $n^2 + n + 1$ is even then $n^2 + n$ must be odd.
  Since $n^2 + n$ is odd, either $n^2$ or $n$ must be odd (since only the sum of
  an odd and even number gives an odd number). But since $n$ is even, $n^2$ must
  be even - this is a contradiction.
  
\end{proof}
